Implement the IDict interface backed by a list and binary search tree.
Name the list backed implementation "Dict" and the BST backed implementation "BSTree".
The files "shortlist.txt" and "words_alpha.txt" should not be committed to your repository.

You should copy over your best list implementation from day 4 to use as the list in the Test program.

Files:
Test.java  - A program that reads in words and randomly searches for them
IList.java - An interface for a list implementation (matches day4)
IDict.java - An interface for dictionaries
shortlist.txt - a 50000 word list
words_alpha.txt - a 370098 word list
DictLink.java - A class that implements list nodes for a dictionary, containing a key and value, as well as other methods for nodes in a binary search tree
Dict.java - A class that implements a dictionary backed by a list
BSTree.java - A class that implements a dictionary backed by a binary search tree
DLink.java - A class that implements doubly-linked list nodes
DoubleLinkList.java - A class that implements a doubly-linked list
IDLink.java - An interface for the link cells in a doubly linked list
